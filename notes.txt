  multi-level queue 
  eq:-
  real_time 
  |_|_|_|_| p=0, q=2
  |_|_|_|_| p=0, q=4
  |_|_|_|_| p=0, q=8

  multiple level feedback queue:-
  1) process must can change there queue
  2) the time quantum ince=rease with decrease in priority


some operating system have a intermidat form of swaping- key idea it can be advantagis to remove a process from a memory and hence from contention of cpu thus deggre of multiprograming later this process can be reintroduce in the memory and reexecution can be continue from it is left
swaping is typical nessery when the memory has to be overcomited    

concurency:- interleaving of process
tw0-paralism:- task paralism , data paralism
chalanges in multi threaded programing 
-> identifing task 
-> balance 
-> while identifing the task that run in parrel program must also ensure in certain curcumstances a program may not contribute a use in ga seprate core for such a task may not worth the task
-> data spliting  
-. data dependency
-> test and debuging
 
Q) read about amdals law
Q) read about diffrent between single thread and multithread process
Q) describ a cenario where a single thread program has to be converted to multi thread program specificly describe each of the five chalanges with respect to this scenarios
